# Decision Ledger

Decisions that don't belong to a single OpenSpec change. Newest first. Never edit past entries; supersede them with a new one.

Format: `## D-NNN: Title (YYYY-MM-DD)`, then context, decision, consequences.

## D-008: Commit often (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** Supersedes the commit timing of D-003. Agents commit after every coherent step without asking; pushing still happens at the latest when the session ends.
- **Why:** User preference: rather too many commits than too few.

## D-007: Real data from carserver sdlog, DBC metadata, local test DB (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** Supersedes the synthetic-data part of D-006. Development uses the existing ClickHouse `sdlog` on carserver (smart451) via SSH tunnel and a read-only user `letsview`. Signal metadata comes from the CarController DBC files. Automated tests use a local Docker ClickHouse with the same schema and synthetic data.
- **Why:** Real data is available; the database has no metadata tables; carserver is too small (2 GB RAM) and not reproducible enough for test runs.

## D-006: ClickHouse first (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** The first data adapter targets ClickHouse (local via Docker, synthetic data). ADX follows behind the same adapter interface.
- **Why:** Reproducible locally without cloud access.

## D-005: Server + browser (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** A server holds workspace state, DB credentials, the data adapters and the CLI endpoint. The browser renders and reports back which state revision it has drawn.
- **Why:** The CLI must control the open view (concept §7) and credentials must stay off the client (§8). Stack is left to the first change's design.

## D-004: Build our own (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** letsview is a custom build. Grafana, ibaAnalyzer, PlotJuggler and Seeq (concept §11) serve as references only.
- **Why:** Decided by the user; resolves the build/buy question of concept §12.

## D-003: Commit and push at session end (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** When the user ends a session, agents commit and push without asking.
- **Why:** No uncommitted work lying around between sessions.

## D-002: Minimal AGENTS.md, decisions in a ledger (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** AGENTS.md only holds rules and links. Decisions OpenSpec doesn't cover (outside a change's design.md) go here. On archive, project-wide decisions from a change's design.md are copied here too.
- **Why:** Keep agent context small; keep decisions findable in one place.

## D-001: OpenSpec, English artifacts (2026-10-14)

- **Decision:** Development is spec-driven with OpenSpec (schema `spec-driven`). Specs, proposals and code are in English. Claude Code is the configured tool (`/opsx:*` commands); `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`.
- **Why:** Spec-driven workflow chosen by the user; English matches code and tooling.
